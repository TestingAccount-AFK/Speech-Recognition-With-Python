# Speech-Recognition-With-Python
Don't you just hate taking notes on lectures and videos? Well, if you do, you came to the right place. Here, we convert audio from a .wav file or use your microphone's input to convert it to text.

To run this, go to terminal and type (one at a time!!!): 'pip3 install kivy', 'pip3 install SpeechRecognition', 'pip3 install filestack-python'
Then click on the code tab here and you should see 'HTTPS' and see a url. Copy that url. 
Then, in the your terminal/command prompt, type: 'git clone <insert url>'
Then change your directory to wherever you cloned the project. Then type in the terminal: 'python main.py'
